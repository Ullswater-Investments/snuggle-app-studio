Instead of weeks of document exchange and manual verifications, the supplier connects their wallet, signs an authorization, and PROCUREDATA automatically verifies their corporate registration against official sources. The result is a verified profile in minutes, not weeks.",
      "actor": "Procurement Director",
      "problem": "Traditional supplier onboarding takes 2-4 weeks, requires manual PDF document exchange, and creates silos of outdated information. Each department maintains its own supplier list, generating inconsistencies and identity fraud risks.",
      "solution": "PROCUREDATA generates a unique DID (did:ethr) for each supplier when connecting their wallet. This DID is verified against official corporate registries through Pontus-X. Once verified, any company in the ecosystem can trust that supplier without repeating verification, creating a decentralized trust network.",

Auditors can verify authenticity without accessing original data.",
      "actor": "Chief Sustainability Officer",
      "problem": "Companies must report emissions from their entire supply chain (Scope 3), but collecting verifiable data from hundreds of suppliers is a manual, error-prone process with no guarantee of authenticity. Auditors question data reliability.",

Compute-to-Data inverts the paradigm: instead of sending data to the algorithm, you send the algorithm to the data. Your AI model runs in a secure sandbox alongside the data, and you only receive results (statistics, trained model), never the original data.",
      "actor": "Chief Technology Officer",
      "problem": "Companies want to monetize sensitive data or train AI on it, but regulations (GDPR, HIPAA) prohibit moving it. Confidentiality agreements are not sufficient technical guarantee.",
